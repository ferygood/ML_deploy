# ML_deploy

Deploy a **machine learning pipeline** predicting house price using [kaggle housing data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). 

## Contents
### First Part
1. Feature Engineering (EDA): understanding what types of data we have, is there any missing values? ...etc
2. Feature Extraction: select features for building the machine learning model
3. Create a ML pipeline using Scikit-learn pipeline, and use \_Scikit-learn APIs\_ to create in-house fit-transform classes.
